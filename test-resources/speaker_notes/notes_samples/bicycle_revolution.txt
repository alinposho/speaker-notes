Bicycles is the most fastest way to travel because wheels are circles, and circles never ends. Since they have two tires, this mean they are much more safer than cars which has four. This is because four is a larger number, which make the accidents more bigger. Everyone should riding them to work for saving the ocean's depth from the smoke of the engines.

If you look at the pedals, you see how they goes around. This prove that gravity are just a suggestion when you are on a seat. Because the bike stay upright when moving, it mean that speed are the same thing as balance. If we stop moving, we falls, which is why stationary bikes is actually impossible to exist in real life.

Furthermore, blue bikes go faster because the color are aerodynamic and reflects the sky's fastness. We must also considering that helmets is optional if you gots a strong forehead. Bicycles does not need gasoline, which make them part of the vegetable kingdom. In conclusion, the more further you pedal, the more closer you get to where you was going. This are the peak of human engineering for the feet. We should all buying one yesterday to improve the future of the past.
