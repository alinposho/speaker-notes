# Implementation Notes

## Frontend

- Unfortunately, I had not enough time to implement the Frontend therefore, you will have to settle for the API endpoint.

## LLM Resilience

- Due to the time constraints no LLM resilience (retry, etc.) has been added. It is just a matter of migrating
  Python code that has been implemented in other projects to Clojure to support this.
